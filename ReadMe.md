# comic-opener

A little program for tracking comics, or anything you want, really
csv format: Name,URL,M,Tu,W,Th,F
include as many days of the week as needed, but as of now it's matched exactly,
so capitilazation has to be correct; this is an easy fix and will be corrected later

arrow keys + enter to navigate menus, select a day to open every item in the CSV
with that day marked, or hit see all to select individual ones with enter and
press O to open them

Coming features: in-program editor, RSS support, keeping track of missed days,
more complex opening (e.g. every other week, every second tuesday, etc)
